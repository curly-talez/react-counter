# React Counter

As a part of learning ReactJS, I have created a React Counter Application.
This is a very basic counter, where we are performing only three operations.

1. Increment Operation
2. Decrement Operation
3. Reset Operation

I have used only one react hook - useState to store the state of the counter in the application.

You can run the application using

```
npm start
```
